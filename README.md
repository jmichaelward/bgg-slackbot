# bgg-slackbot
A bot for Slack that integrates with BoardGameGeek.

## About
This project scratches three itches in one:
- I'll continue to grow my knowledge of the [Python](https://python.org) programming language.
- I'll get to learn how to create a custom bot for [Slack](https://slack.com).
- I'll have [another project](https://github.com/jmichaelward/board-game-collector) that
    integrates with the [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com) API.
    
 As such, this repo isn't yet ready for production, which is probably pretty evident
 the second you start poking around at the code base. That said, I'll update this README
 at some magical point in the future when I think it's worth looking at, and hopefully some
 kind folks out there will consider installing it and helping me test!
